## Hi, I'm SilverCopper👋

I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Bioinformatics at Tongji University, and I will pursue my Ph.D. at Cheng Li Lab, Peking University, starting in 2026. My current research focuses on the data analysis of single-cell proteomics, with a particular emphasis on developing computational methods for multi-omics integration of single-cell proteomic data.
