## Hi, I'm SilverCopper👋

I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Bioinformatics at Tongji University, and I will pursue my Ph.D. at Cheng Li Lab, Peking University, starting in 2026. My current research focuses on the data analysis of single-cell proteomics🧪 and the development of AI computational models for cell fate determination🧬.
